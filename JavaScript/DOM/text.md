 # DOM(document object model) ğŸš€
 ğŸ‘‰document object model(DOM) is an application programming interface(API)
 for manipulating HTML and XML documents(add, remove and modify) parts of document ğŸš€
 ğŸ‘‰ When a web page is loaded the browser creates a document object model
 of the page ğŸš€
 ğŸ‘‰ With the object model JavaScript gets all the power it needs to 
 create dynamic HTML ğŸš€

 # What JavaScript do ğŸš€
 ğŸ‘‰ JavaScript can change all the HTMl elements in the page.
 ğŸ‘‰ JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
 ğŸ‘‰ JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page.
 ğŸ‘‰ JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page.
 
 # Points to Remember ğŸ‘‡
 ğŸ‘‰ In the DOM all HTML elements are defined as objects. so it will 
 have both property and method.
 ğŸ‘‰ if you want to access any element in HTML page you always start
 with accessing the document object.
